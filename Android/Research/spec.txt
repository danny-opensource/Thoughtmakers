Basic Idea :

A system which notifies the user about the delicacies available within 'x' meters of his/her location. The idea is to localize the need for searching the 
food items. Basically an app installed on the smart phone with access to the internet.
-The notification will be based on the user feedback/reviews for that food item.
-Data munging needs to be done in order to rate a particular food item at a particular restaurant by collection all the reviews for that place from various sources
-Provide functionality to :
-- Search for particular food / restaurant
-- Rank a food/restaurnt higher on the search result( paid )
-- Direction via map to that place.
